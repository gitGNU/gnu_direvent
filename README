* Overview

Direvent is a directory content watcher daemon, i.e. a program that
monitors a set of directories on the file system and reacts when
their content changes. When a change is detected, the daemon reacts by
invoking an external command configured for that kind of change.

The program aims to provide a uniform and system-independent
command-level interface for file system events.  This version
is known to work on GNU/Linux (kernels starting from
v. 2.6.13) and BSD systems (FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD, Darwin). 

* Building and Configuring

The usual incantation applies:

   ./configure [OPTIONS]
   make
   make install
  
See the file INSTALL for the description of ./configure and its
generic options.

* Usage Instructions

Complete documentation is included with the package, both in man
and Texinfo formats. After successful installation, use

   info direvent

to read the Texinfo documentation.  To read the manpages, use:

   man 8 direvent
   man 5 direvent.conf

An online copy of the documentation in various formats is available
at http://direvent.man.gnu.org.ua.
