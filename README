* Overview

Dircond is a directory content watcher daemon, i.e. a program that
monitors a set of directories on the file system and reacts when
their content changes. The following changes are monitored: file
creation, file removal, file update, move of a file between
directories. When a change is detected, the daemon reacts by invoking
an external command configured for that kind of change.

* Building and Configuring

The utility is Linux-specific, therefore no configuration script is
provided. Run 'make' to build the program, and run 'make install' as a
superuser to install it. The utility name is 'dircond' and it is
installed in /usr/local/bin. To change the installation directory, use
the PREFIX make variable. For example, the following command:

   make install PREFIX=/usr

will install the daemon binary in /usr/bin and the manpage in
/usr/share/man/man1.

Specific installation directories can be overridden using the
following variables:

  BINDIR      the directory where the binary is to be installed
  MANDIR      the directory where the manpage is to be installed

* Usage Instructions

See dircond(1) for a detailed documentation.
