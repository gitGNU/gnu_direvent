Version 5.1, 2016-07-06

* Globbing patterns in #include statement

If argument to the #include statement contains wildcard characters (*, [,
], or ?), it is interpreted as shell globbing pattern and all files
matching that pattern are included, in lexicographical order.  If no
matching files are found, the directive is replaced with an empty
line.

* New watcher option 'shell'

The 'shell' option causes watcher command to be executed via
'/bin/sh' (by default it is invoked directly, using the 'execve'
function).  For example:

  watcher {
     path "/etc/httpd/vhosts";
     command "/usr/bin/scanhosts && service httpd restart";
     option (shell);
  }

* Include path

If the argument to the #include (#include_once) statement is not an
absolute file name or globbing pattern, it is looked up in the include
search path.  The order of look up is as follows.  First, directories 
given with '-I' options (see below) are scanned, in the same order as
given on the command line.  If no matching file is found in any of
them, directories in the standard include search path are scanned.

By default, the standard include search path contains two directories:
'$(pkgdatadir)/$(VERSION)' and '$(pkgdatadir)/include', where
$(pkgdatadir) and $(VERSION) stand for the package data directory, and
package version, correspondingly.  It can be redefined at compile time using
the '--with-include-path' to configure, e.g.:

 ./configure --with-include-path='$(sysconfdir)/direvent.d:$(pkgdatadir)/$(VERSION):$(pkgdatadir)/include'

(see the file INSTALL, section "Building and Configuring", for a
detailed discussion of this option).
 
To inspect the actual path at runtime, run 'direvent --help',
and look for the string 'Include search path:' in its output.
  
* New command line option -I (--include)

The '-I DIR' command line option adds DIR to the include search path.
When looking for include files, directories given with '-I' options
are scanned first.  If the file is not found, the directories in the
standard include path are scanned.


Version 5.0, 2014-09-06

* An official GNU release

* The "file" statement allows for negating patterns

* I18N


Version 4.1, 2013-12-27

* New features

A watcher can be configured to react only on certain files.  To that
effect, a new statement "file" is introduced.  This statement defines
a list of regular expressions one of which the file name must match in
order for the watcher to wake up.

* Bugfixes

Upon creation of a directory, a genev_create event is generated for
all files and directories below the newly created one (if required
by the configuration).  At the same time, new watchers are installed.

The version 4.0 incorrectly assumed that a notification would arrive
for each subdirectory or subfile, once the watcher is installed for
the parent directory.  This created a race condition, which could
cause some create events to come unnoticed.

Version 4.0, 2013-06-04

This is a complete rewrite of the project.  It uses a new
configuration file format and works on Linux, BSD and Darwin.


Version 3.0 (Git)

Introduce a configuration file.


Version 2.0, 2013-01-11

* Change command line handling

Dircond accepts handler definitions interspersed with directory
name.  This allows for having different per-directory handlers.

Similarly, the autowatch options ("-a" and "-l") affect the
directories specified after them in the command line and their effect
is changed by the next occurrence of the corresponding option.

* Bugfixes

Fix a minor error in fd_set handling.
