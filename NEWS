Introduce a configuration file.


Version 2.0, 2013-01-11

* Change command line handling

Dircond accepts handler definitions interspersed with directory
name.  This allows for having different per-directory handlers.

Similarly, the autowatch options ("-a" and "-l") affect the
directories specified after them in the command line and their effect
is changed by the next occurrence of the corresponding option.

* Bugfixes

Fix a minor error in fd_set handling.
