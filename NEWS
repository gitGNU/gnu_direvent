Version 4.1.90, Git

Version 4.1, 2013-12-27

* New features

A watcher can be configured to react only on certain files.  To that
effect, a new statement "file" is introduced.  This statement defines
a list of regular expressions one of which the file name must match in
order for the watcher to wake up.

* Bugfixes

Upon creation of a directory, a genev_create event is generated for
all files and directories below the newly created one (if required
by the configuration).  At the same time, new watchers are installed.

The version 4.0 incorrectly assumed that a notification would arrive
for each subdirectory or subfile, once the watcher is installed for
the parent directory.  This created a race condition, which could
cause some create events to come unnoticed.

Version 4.0, 2013-06-04

This is a complete rewrite of the project.  It uses a new
configuration file format and works on Linux, BSD and Darwin.


Version 3.0 (Git)

Introduce a configuration file.


Version 2.0, 2013-01-11

* Change command line handling

Direvent accepts handler definitions interspersed with directory
name.  This allows for having different per-directory handlers.

Similarly, the autowatch options ("-a" and "-l") affect the
directories specified after them in the command line and their effect
is changed by the next occurrence of the corresponding option.

* Bugfixes

Fix a minor error in fd_set handling.
